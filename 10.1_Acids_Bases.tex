\section*{\emph{Your World}}
\paragraph{By Georgia Douglas Johnson}~
\begin{verse}
	Your world is as big as you make it.\\
	I know, for I used to abide\\
	In the narrowest nest in a corner,\\
	My wings pressing close to my side.
	
	But I sighted the distant horizon\\
	Where the skyline encircled the sea\\
	And I throbbed with a burning desire\\
	To travel this immensity.
	
	I battered the cordons around me\\
	And cradled my wings on the breeze,\\
	Then soared to the uttermost reaches\\
	With rapture, with power, with ease!
\end{verse}

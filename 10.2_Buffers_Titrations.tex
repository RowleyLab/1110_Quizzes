\section*{\emph{When You See Water}}
\paragraph{By Alice Walker}~
\begin{verse}
	When you see water in a stream\\
	you say: oh, this is stream\\
	water;\\
	When you see water in the river\\
	you say: oh, this is water\\
	of the river;\\
	When you see ocean\\
	water\\
	you say: This is the ocean's\\
	water!\\
	But actually water is always\\
	only itself\\
	and does not belong\\
	to any of these containers\\
	though it creates them.\\
	And so it is with you.
\end{verse}

\section*{\emph{Wild Geese}}
\paragraph{By Mary Oliver}~
\begin{verse}
	You do not have to be good.\\
	You do not have to walk on your knees\\
	for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.\\
	You only have to let the soft animal of your body\\
	love what it loves.\\
	Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.\\
	Meanwhile the world goes on.\\
	Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain\\
	are moving across the landscapes,\\
	over the prairies and the deep trees,\\
	the mountains and the rivers.\\
	Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,\\
	are heading home again.\\
	Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,\\
	the world offers itself to your imagination,\\
	calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -\\
	over and over announcing your place\\
	in the family of things.
\end{verse}

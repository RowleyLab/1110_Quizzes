\subsection*{Question 1}
Classify each of the following compounds as a \emph{strong} electrolyte, \emph{weak} electrolyte, or \emph{non}-electrolyte

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \ch{Ca(NO3)2}
	\item \ch{N2}
	\item \ch{HNO3}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \ch{H2CO3}
		\item \ch{NH3}
		\item \ch{C6H12O6}
	\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\subsection*{Question 2}
Give the molal concentration of solute particles in the following solutions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $0.75M$ \ch{MgCl2}
	\item $0.25M$ \ch{CH3CH2OH}
	\item A solution with $0.2M$ \ch{NaCl} and $0.3M$ \ch{CHCl3}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 3}
Find the freezing point of an aqueous solution with $1.5M$ \ch{MgSO4}. Water has a freezing point depression constant of $-1.86\nicefrac{^\circ C}{m}$

\vspace{7em}
\subsection*{Question 4}
Saline solution commonly used in medical practice is made by dissolving $9g$ of \ch{NaCl} in $1L$ of solution. Find the osmotic pressure of saline solution (in atm)

\section*{\emph{Good Bones}}
\paragraph{By Maggie Smith}~
\begin{verse}
	Life is short, though I keep this from my children.\\
	Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine\\
	in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,\\
	a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways\\
	I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least\\
	fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative\\
	estimate, though I keep this from my children.\\
	For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.\\
	For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,\\
	sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world\\
	is at least half terrible, and for every kind\\
	stranger, there is one who would break you,\\
	though I keep this from my children. I am trying\\
	to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,\\
	walking you through a real shithole, chirps on\\
	about good bones: This place could be beautiful,\\
	right? You could make this place beautiful.

\subsection*{Question 1}
Use Table 7.1 from your textbook to find the enthalpy for the combustion of methane gas:\\ \ch{CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)}

\vspace{5em}
\subsection*{Question 2}
Use your answer from question 1 to find how many $J$ of heat are released when $5.0~g$ of \ch{CH4} react with excess \ch{O2}

\vspace{5em}
\subsection*{Question 3}
Use Table 7.1 from your textbook to find the enthalpy for the following reaction:\\ \ch{2 NH3(g) -> N2(g) + 3 H2(g)}

\vspace{5em}
\subsection*{Question 4}
Use your answer from question 3 to find the enthalpy change when $2.0~g$ of \ch{NH3} decompose into \ch{H2} and \ch{N2}

\vspace{5em}
\subsection*{Question 5}
\ch{AgCl} is usually considered an \emph{insoluble} salt, but we can discuss its solvation in theoretical terms\\
The reaction is: \ch{AgCl(s) -> Ag^+{aq} + Cl^-(aq)}\hspace{1em}$\Delta H_{rxn} = +65.49~\dfrac{kJ}{mol}$\\
Is there any temperature condition where \ch{AgCl} might actually become soluble?

\section*{\emph{Pioneers}}
\paragraph{By Carol Lynn Pearson}~
\begin{verse}
	My people were Mormon pioneers.\\	
	Is the blood still good?\\	
	They stood in awe as truth\\
	Flew by like a dove\\
	And dropped a feather in the West.\\
	Where truth flies you follow\\	
	If you are a pioneer.\\
	I have searched the skies\\
	And now and then\\
	Another feather has fallen.\\
	I have packed the handcart again\\	
	Packed it with the precious things\\
	And thrown away the rest.\\
	I will sing by the fires at night\\	
	Out there on uncharted ground\\
	Where I am my own captain of tens\\	
	Where I blow the bugle\\
	Bring myself to morning prayer\\
	Map out the miles\\
	And never know when or where\\
	Or if at all I will finally say,\\
	“This is the place,”\\
	I face the plains\\
	On a good day for walking.\\
	The sun rises\\
	And the mist clears.\\
	I will be all right:\\
	My people were Mormon Pioneers.
\end{verse}

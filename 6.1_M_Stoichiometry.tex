\subsection*{Question 1}
How many grams will a $0.25~mol$ sample of each compound weigh?

\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\ch{CO2} \hspace{18em} & \ch{CH3CO2H} \\ \\ \\ \\
	\ch{Mg(NO3)2} & \ch{Ag2CO3}
\end{tabular}

\vspace{5em}
\subsection*{Question 2}
How many moles are in a $2.50~g$ sample of each compound?

\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\ch{(NH4)2CO3} \hspace{18em} & \ch{H2} \\ \\ \\ \\
	\ch{Mg(NO3)2} & \ch{SF6}
\end{tabular}

\vspace{5em}
\subsection*{Question 3}
Consider the reaction: \ch{C3H8 (g) + 5 O2(g) <=> 3 CO2(g) + 4 H2O(g)}

\noindent How many moles of \ch{O2} are required to react with $0.750~mol$ of \ch{C3H8}?

\vspace{2em}\noindent How many moles of \ch{CO2} and \ch{H2O} would be produced?

\section*{\emph{My Voice}}
\paragraph{By Rafael Campo}~
\begin{verse}
	To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,\\
	I wrote a Cuban song about the need\\
	For people to suppress their fantasies,\\
	Especially unhealthy ones. The song\\
	Began by making reference to the sea,\\
	Because the sea is like a need so great\\
	And deep it never can be swallowed. Then\\
	The song explores some common myths\\
	About the Cuban people and their folklore:\\
	The story of a little Carib boy\\
	Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;\\
	The legend of a bird who wanted song\\
	So desperately he gave up flight; a queen\\
	Whose strength was greater than a rival kingâ€™s.\\
	The song goes on about morality,\\
	And then there is a line about the sea,\\
	How deep it is, how many creatures need\\
	Its nourishment, how beautiful it is\\
	To need. The song is ending now, because\\
	I cannot bear to hear it any longer.\\
	I call this song of needful love my voice.
\end{verse}

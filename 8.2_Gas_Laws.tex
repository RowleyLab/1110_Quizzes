\subsection*{Question 1}
A weather balloon starts in Cedar City with with $P=0.82~atm$, $T=21.5~^\circ C$, and $V=18.75~L$

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the number of moles of gas inside the balloon
	
	\vspace{2em}
	\item If the balloon is filled with \ch{He} gas, find the mass of the gas inside the balloon
	
	\vspace{2em}
	\item Find the density of the \ch{He}-filled balloon (assume the instruments and balloon itself have no mass)
	
	\vspace{2em}
	\item Find the density of the surrounding air (assume it is $100\%$ \ch{N2} gas)
\end{itemize}
	
\vspace{2em}
\subsection*{Question 2}
The weather balloon is released into the upper atmosphere and the instruments on-board indicate a pressure of $0.45~atm$ and a temperature of $-32.4~^\circ C$

\noindent What will the new volume of the balloon be?

\vspace{4em}
\subsection*{Question 3}
A car engine burns about $0.1~g$ of gasoline (\ch{C8H18})for each engine cycle. A car engine may have a cylinder volume of $1.25~L$, and operate at a temperature of $80.0~^\circ C$. If the gasoline combusts completely inside the $1.25~L$ piston, what is the pressure of the combustion products?

\section*{\emph{Because I Could Not Stop for Death (479)}}
\paragraph{By Emily Dickinson}~
\begin{verse}
	Because I could not stop for Death –\\
	He kindly stopped for me –\\
	The Carriage held but just Ourselves –\\
	And Immortality.
	
	We slowly drove – He knew no haste\\
	And I had put away\\
	My labor and my leisure too,\\
	For His Civility –
	
	We passed the School, where Children strove\\
	At Recess – in the Ring –\\
	We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –\\
	We passed the Setting Sun –
	
	Or rather – He passed Us –\\
	The Dews drew quivering and Chill –\\
	For only Gossamer, my Gown –\\
	My Tippet – only Tulle –
	
	We paused before a House that seemed\\
	A Swelling of the Ground –\\
	The Roof was scarcely visible –\\
	The Cornice – in the Ground –
	
	Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet\\
	Feels shorter than the Day\\
	I first surmised the Horses' Heads\\
	Were toward Eternity –
\end{verse}
